1)Set up my vs code and made a post page connected to my db

2)Had a problem with sorting the data in the posts. Tried to sort it how we did it in the demo but always had an error. That small peace of code was taken from chat gpt. Sorry for that but I decided not to stop there fot long time. Just asked him to tell what am I doing wromg and why. Will rewatch the demo from that day and practice it more.
3)Moved the db out from the component posts
4)Made A dunamic route for the posts
5)Added Header and a nav bar
6)Created a newpost function. Now we can add the posts directly to the db
7)Spent an hour adding a time stamp to my posts. It appeared that if you add the column to existing table it does not work properly. Droped the table and created the new one
8)Implemented Delete Button with a help of other students in breakroom, lesson demo and a lot of googling
9)Added an Img on homescreen and did some styling with tailwind
10)I used Tailwind on the posts page because I couldn't solve the styling issue any other way. Took an idea from one of the websites I use and used it here.
11)Added metadata to the pages
