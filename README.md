1)Set up my vs code and made a post page connected to my db

2)Had a problem with sorting the data in the posts. Tried to sort it how we did it in the demo but always had an error. That small peace of code was taken from chat gpt. Sorry for that but I decided not to stop there fot long time. Just asked him to tell what am I doing wromg and why. Will rewatch the demo from that day and practice it more.
3)Moved the db out from the component posts
